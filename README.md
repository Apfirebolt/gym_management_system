# A Gym Membership online portal

This simple web application keeps track of records in a Gym. Application can be used to add new users, plans and more for a Gym.
Users can be associated with a plan to keep track of payments and facilities offered. Might also be extended to add 'Complaints' model where users can submit complaints for Gym staff members to take care of.

Another possible model which can be added in the future is 'equipment' which keeps track of how many equipments exist in the gym.

This project uses custom authentication system in Django made by extending base user class. Gym admin and the members share the same portal.

This project uses Materialize CSS for UI components.
